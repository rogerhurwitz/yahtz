## Object
Roll dice for scoring combinations, and get the
highest total score.

## Game Summary
On each turn, roll the dice up to 3 times to get the highest scoring combination
or one of 13 categories. After you finish rolling, you must place a score or a
zero in one of the 13 category boxes on your score card. The game ends when all
players have filled in their 13 boxes. Scores are totaled, including any bonus
points. The player with the highest total wins.

## How to Play
Each player takes a score card. To decide who goes first, each player in turn
rolls all 5 dice. The player with the highest total goes first. Play then passes
to the left.

## TAKING A TURN
On your turn, you may roll the dice up to 3 times, although you may stop and
score after your first or second roll. To roll the dice, place them in the dice
cup, shake them up, and roll them out.

**First roll:** Roll all 5 dice. Set any "keepers" aside. You may stop and score
now, or roll again.

**Second roll:** Reroll ANY or ALL dice you want - even "keepers" from the
previous roll. You don't need to declare which combination you're rolling for;
you may change your mind after any roll. You may stop and score after your
second roll, or set aside any "keepers" and roll a third time.

**Third and final roll:** Reroll ANY or ALL dice you want. After your third
roll, you must fill in a box on your score card with a score or a zero. After
you fill in a box, your turn is over.

## SCORING
When you are finished rolling, decide which box to fill in on your score card.
For each game, there is a column of 13 boxes. You must fill in a box on each
turn; if you can't (or don't want to) enter a score, you must enter a zero. Fill
in each box only once, in any order, depending on your best scoring option. The
score card is divided into an Upper Section and a Lower Section. Scoring
combinations for each section are explained below.

|Upper Section|What to Score|
|-------------|-------------|
|Aces (Ones)|Total of Aces only|
|Twos|Total of Twos only|
|Threes|Total of Threes only|
|Fours|Total of Fours only|
|Fives|Total of Fives only|
|Sixes|Total of Sixes only|



To score in the Upper Section, add only the dice with the same number and enter
the total in the appro- priate box. For example, with the dice shown below you
could score 9 in the Threes box, 2 in the Twos box or 4 in the Fours box.

|3|3|3|2|4|
|-|-|-|-|-|

Your goal in the Upper Section is to score a total of at least 63 points, to
earn a 35-point bonus. The bonus points are based on scoring three of each
number (Aces through Sixes); however, you may earn the bonus with any
combination of scores totaling 63 points or more. 

Each of the Lower Section scoring combinations is explained in detail in the
next column.

|Lower Section|What to Score|
|-|-|
|3 of a Kind| Total of all 5 dice|
|4 of a Kind| Total of all 5 dice|
|Full House | 25 points|
|Small Straight| 30 points|
|Large Straight |40 points|
|YAHTZEE (5 of a Kind)| 50 points|
|Chance |Total of all 5 dice|

**3 of a Kind:** Score in this
box only if the dice include
3 or more of the same
number. For example, with
the dice shown below you
could score 18 points in the
3 of a Kind box.
|5|5|5|2|1|
|-|-|-|-|-|

*Other Scoring Options:* You could instead score 18 in the Chance box, or you
could score in the Upper Section: 15 in the Fives box, 2 in the Twos box or 1 in
the Aces box.

**4 of a Kind:** Score in this box only if the dice include 4 or more of the same
num- ber. For example, with the dice shown below you could score 14 points in
the 4 of a Kind box.
|2|2|2|2|6|
|-|-|-|-|-|

*Other Scoring Options:* You could instead score 14 in the 3 of a Kind box or in
the Chance boxâ€”or you could score in the Upper Section: 8 in the Twos box, or 6
in the Sixes box.

**Full House:** Score in this box only if the dice show three of one number and two
of another. Any Full House is worth 25 points. For example, with the dice shown
below you could score 25 points in the Full House box.
|3|3|3|5|5|
|-|-|-|-|-|

*Other Scoring Options:* You could instead score 19 in the 3 of a Kind box or in
the Chance box-or you could score in the Upper Section: 9 in the Threes box or
10 in the Fives box.

**Small Straight:** Score in this box only if the dice show any sequence of four
numbers. Any Small Straight is worth 30 points. You could score 30 points in the
Small Straight box with any of the three dice combinations shown below.

| | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|2|3|4|X|
|2|3|4|5|X|
|3|4|5|6|X|

*Other Scoring Options:* You could instead score in the Chance box, or in the
appro- priate Upper Section box.

**Large Straight:** Score in this box only if the dice show any sequence of five
numbers. Any Large Straight is worth 40 points. You could score 40 points in the
Large Straight box with either of the two dice combinations shown below.
| | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|2|3|4|5|
|2|3|4|5|6|

*Other Scoring Options:* You could instead score in the Small Straight box, the
Chance box, or the appropri- ate Upper Section box.

**YAHTZEE:** Score in this box only if the dice show five of the same number (5 of a
kind). A YAHTZEE example is shown below.
|1|1|1|1|1|
|-|-|-|-|-|

The first YAHTZEE you enter in the YAHTZEE box is worth 50 points. For each
additional YAHTZEE you roll, you earn a bonus (see YAHTZEE BONUS, below)!

Chance: Score the total of any 5 dice in this box. This catch-all category comes
in handy when you can't (or don't want to) score in another category, and don't
want to enter a zero.

For example, you could score 22 points in the Chance box with the dice shown
below.
|1|4|5|6|6|
|-|-|-|-|-|

**YAHTZEE BONUS:** If you roll a YAHTZEE and have already filled in the YAHTZEE
box with a 50, you get a 100-point bonus! Take one bonus chip, then 5 place a
check mark (V) in the YAHTZEE BONUS box on your score card. Then fill in one of
the 13 boxes on your score card according to the JOKER RULES, described below.

As long as you've scored 50 in the YAHTZEE box, you get a YAHTZEE bonus for each
additional YAHTZEE you roll - just squeeze in the check marks if necessary!

If you roll a YAHTZEE and have already entered zero in the YAHTZEE box, you do
not earn a YAHTZEE bonus; however, you must fill in one of the 13 boxes on your
score card according to the JOKER RULES below.

**JOKER RULES:** Score the total of all 5 dice in the appropriate Upper Section
box. If this box has already been filled in, score as follows in any free Lower
Section box:
- *3 of a Kind:* Total of all 5 dice
- *4 of a Kind:* Total of all 5 dice
- *Full House:* 25 points
- *Small Straight:* 30 points
- *Large Straight:* 40 points
- *Chance:* Total of all 5 dice

If the appropriate Upper Section box and all Lower Section boxes are filled in,
you must enter a zero in any open Upper Section box. For example, you roll 5
Fours. You've already entered zero in the YAHTZEE box, and have also scored in
the Fours box in the Upper Section. The Joker rules allow you to score in any
open box in the Lower Section. You decide to score 40 points in the Large
Straight box.

## ENDING A GAME
Once each player has filled in all 13 category boxes, the game ends. Each player
now adds up his or her score as follows:

**Upper Section:** Add up the Upper Section scores and enter the total in the TOTAL
SCORE box. Enter the 35-point bonus in the BONUS box if you scored 63 points or
more. Then enter the total in the TOTAL box.

**Lower Section:** Add up the Lower Section scores, and enter the total in the TOTAL
of Lower Section box. Add 100 points for each check mark in the YAHTZEE BONUS
boxes (that is, one check mark for each bonus chip). 

**Grand Total:** Add the Upper
Section and Lower Section scores, and enter the total in this box. This is your
score for the game.

## How to Win
After the scores are tallied, the player with the highest Grand Total wins the
game!
